    abstract = {A series of proposed bands in 18O with potential nuclear molecular structures, such as 14C ⊗ α or 12C ⊗ 2n ⊗  α, are being investigated. This was done through the use of the Q3D magnetic spectrograph at the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratory in Munich in conjunction with an array of double-sided silicon strip detectors (DSSDs). These detectors allowed for high resolution reconstruction of detected particles, enabling measurement of the branching ratios of the states that make up these bands. Here, a method is discussed for extracting the branching ratios of both material particles as well as γ-particles using the DSSD array to detect only charged decay fragments.},

abstract = {Two novel approaches to improving the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) for silicon resistive charge-division strip detectors (RSDs), when performing low energy charged-particle spectroscopy, are presented. Firstly, the normally-unutilised rear contact of the detector was used to veto events where the charge collected by this rear face did not match the sum of the charges collected by the strips on the front. Secondly, leading edge discriminator time walk was used to determine complementary information about the hit position along a strip. Using this alongside the position extracted from the charge division allowed clearer identification of true events over background, leading to an improved SBR. These methods were tested by measuring radiation from a triple-α source and then the 12C(4He, α)ααα breakup reaction at 40 MeV beam energy. The first method was found to improve the SBR by a factor of 4.0(2). The second method gave a SBR improvement of factor of 3.7(4). When both methods are applied together, a total improvement by a factor of 5.7(3) was measured.}

title = {High multiplicity α-particle breakup measurements to study α-condensate states},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {An experiment was performed to investigate α-condensate states via high α-particle multiplicity breakup. The nucleus of interest was 28Si therefore to measure multiplicity 7 particle breakup events, a highly granular detector with a high solid angle coverage was required. For this purpose, the CHIMERA and FARCOS detectors at INFN LNS were employed. Particle identification was achieved through ΔE-E energy loss. The α-particle multiplicity was measured at three beam energies to investigate different excitation regimes in 28Si. At a beam energy where the energy is sufficient to provide the 7 α-particles with enough energy to be identified using the ΔE-E method, multiplicity 7 events can be seen. Given these high multiplicity events, the particles can be reconstructed to investigate the breakup of α-condensate states. Analysing the decay paths of these states can elucidate whether the state of interest corresponds to a non-cluster, clustered or condensed state.}
