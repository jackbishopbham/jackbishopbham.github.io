abstract = {Direct measurements of the total fusion cross section for B8+40Ar were achieved with the active target technique. The fusion excitation function was extracted at energies near the Coulomb barrier. The cross section is well described by a coupled reaction channels calculation. The data were compared with previous B8 fusion experiments on Si28 and Ni58 targets. No evidence of striking enhancement of the total fusion cross section at near the Coulomb barrier, that was previously reported for the B8+58Ni system, was observed in these direct measurements. The present data are systematically consistent with the results for B8+28Si at higher energies and with other weakly-bound systems at near-barrier energies.}

abstract={Our present understanding of the structure of the Hoyle state in {\$}{\$}^{\{}12{\}}{\$}{\$}C and other near-threshold states in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-conjugate nuclei is reviewed in the framework of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-condensate model. The {\$}{\$}^{\{}12{\}}{\$}{\$}C Hoyle state, in particular, is a candidate for {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-condensation, due to its large radius and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-cluster structure. The predicted features of nuclear {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-particle condensates are reviewed along with a discussion of their experimental indicators, with a focus on precision break-up measurements. Two experiments are discussed in detail, firstly concerning the break-up of {\$}{\$}^{\{}12{\}}{\$}{\$}C and then the decays of heavier nuclei. With more theoretical input, and increasingly complex detector setups, precision break-up measurements can, in principle, provide insight into the structures of states in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-conjugate nuclei. However, the commonly-held belief that the decay of a condensate state will result in N{\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-particles is challenged. We further conclude that unambiguously characterising excited states built on {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}-condensates is difficult, despite improvements in detector technology.},

abstract = {β-delayed charged-particle emission is a sensitive probe of three-body decays in light nuclei. Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) offer a significant advantage over traditional charged-particle spectroscopy techniques due to a low-energy threshold and a high-geometric efficiency (≈4π) which are essential for use with radioactive ion beams where the beam intensities are limited. The technique for high-sensitivity spectroscopy of β-delayed charged-particle emission is shown to be possible using the Texas Active Target (TexAT) TPC in conjunction with the General Electronics for TPCs (GET) system. The benchmark case studied was that of 12N β-decay to the first α-unbound state in 12C, the Hoyle state. Half-life and branching ratio measurements are presented and are in good agreement with previous studies. The efficacy of using TPCs to study such a near-threshold state and disentangle the three-body dynamics of the decay products is demonstrated.}

ABSTRACT = {We present an open-source kinematic fitting routine designed for low-energy nuclear physics applications. Although kinematic fitting is commonly used in high-energy particle physics, it is rarely used in low-energy nuclear physics, despite its effectiveness. A FORTRAN and ROOT C++ version of the FUNKI_FIT kinematic fitting code have been developed and published open access. The FUNKI_FIT code is universal in the sense that the constraint equations can be easily modified to suit different experimental set-ups and reactions. Two case studies for the use of this code, utilising experimental and Monte–Carlo data, are presented: (1) charged-particle spectroscopy using silicon-strip detectors; (2) charged-particle spectroscopy using active target detectors. The kinematic fitting routine provides an improvement in resolution in both cases, demonstrating, for the first time, the applicability of kinematic fitting across a range of nuclear physics applications. The ROOT macro has been developed in order to easily apply this technique in standard data analysis routines used by the nuclear physics community.},

abstract = {In the past several years, there has been a large interest of Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) for use in experimental nuclear physics. This has continued in tandem with the requirement for high efficiency detectors with low intensity radioactive ion beams. TexAT is a Active Target TPC (AT-TPC) built at Texas A&amp;M University utilizing MICRO MEsh GASeous (MicroMegas) pads and GET electronics developed specifically for TPCs. This design combines good TPC pixelation with a surrounding shell of Si/CsI telescopes to make an extremely versatile detector capable of a wide range of different experimental techniques with only minor modifications to the electronics setup. Two recent experiments performed at the Cyclotron Institute, Texas A&amp;M University, are detailed here demonstrating versatility beyond the usual Thick Target Inverse Kinematics (TTIK) or transfer reactions that these TPCs are more typically used for. The first, a measurement of the 12N → 12C* → 3α decay demonstrates the capabilities of TexAT as a low-energy detector operating at low pressure (20 Torr) to measure β-delayed particle decay. The second, a direct measurement of the 8B+40Ar fusion cross section shows the advantages of operating in active target mode where the target also functions as the detector gas.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Two recent experiments have indicated that the break-up of the 12C Hoyle state is dominated by the sequential 8Be(g.s.) + α decay channel. The rare direct 3α decay was found to contribute with a branching ratio of less than 0.047% (95% C.L.). However, the ability of experimentalists to successfully disentangle these two competing decay channels relies on accurate theoretical predictions of how they each manifest in phase space distribution of the three break-up α-particles. The following paper reviews the current theoretical approaches to calculating the break-up of the Hoyle state and introduces a semi-classical WKB approach, which adequately reproduces the results of more sophisticated calculations. It is proposed that a more accurate upper limit on this branching ratio may be obtained if these new theoretical results are taken into account when analysing experimental data.}

Firstly, the normally-unutilised rear contact of the detector was used to veto events where the charge collected by this rear face did not match the sum of the charges collected by the strips on the front. Secondly, leading edge discriminator time walk was used to determine complementary information about the hit position along a strip. Using this alongside the position extracted from the charge division allowed clearer identification of true events over background, leading to an improved SBR. These methods were tested by measuring radiation from a triple-α source and then the 12C(4He, α)ααα breakup reaction at 40 MeV beam energy. The first method was found to improve the SBR by a factor of 4.0(2). The second method gave a SBR improvement of factor of 3.7(4). When both methods are applied together, a total improvement by a factor of 5.7(3) was measured.}

abstract = {An experiment was performed to investigate α-condensate states via high α-particle multiplicity breakup. The nucleus of interest was 28Si therefore to measure multiplicity 7 particle breakup events, a highly granular detector with a high solid angle coverage was required. For this purpose, the CHIMERA and FARCOS detectors at INFN LNS were employed. Particle identification was achieved through ΔE-E energy loss. The α-particle multiplicity was measured at three beam energies to investigate different excitation regimes in 28Si. At a beam energy where the energy is sufficient to provide the 7 α-particles with enough energy to be identified using the ΔE-E method, multiplicity 7 events can be seen. Given these high multiplicity events, the particles can be reconstructed to investigate the breakup of α-condensate states. Analysing the decay paths of these states can elucidate whether the state of interest corresponds to a non-cluster, clustered or condensed state.}
