When we look at the world around us, it is full of a rich tapestry of different elements. We may very well ask ourselves where these elements come from? Models of the early Universe tell us that only hydrogen, helium and small amounts of other light elements are created in the Big Bang. Explaining where all the elements we see around us come from is a key area of nuclear physics known as nuclear astrophysics - the key insight is that is inside stars that the Universe creates a huge variety of different isotopes.

The fuel that drives stars to generate tremendous amounts of energy is (primarily) through nuclear fusion, joining together light nuclei to form heavier ones generates large amounts of energy. Eventually, fusing together lighter nuclei no longer becomes energetically favourable and around iron/nickel - fusion becomes an _endothermic_ reaction. So how are heavier elements produced? The answer lies in neutrons that are also produced inside of stars. In the later stage of a stars life, when it is in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stage, the heavy `ashes` sequentially absorb neutrons and then undergo beta-decay (converting the neutrons in the nucleus to protons). This is known as the s-process. With a very intensity of neutrons, we have access to directly measure these nucleosynthesis reactions here on Earth. This is a possibility with the Birmingham High Flux Accelerator-Driven Neutron Facility, HF-ADNeF.
